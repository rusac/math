- [In defence of doing sums in genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-019-0195-1) - *"There has been a long history of the use of mathematics in genetics, ranging from the use of statistics to analyse genetic data to genetic models of evolutionary processes. Contemporary research into the genomic basis of disease and complex traits exemplifies the importance of statistical methods in genetics. Some examples of the development and application of population genetic models are described, which are intended to highlight the utility of such models for understanding variation and evolution in natural populations. The effects of selection on variability at sites linked to the targets of selection illustrate how fruitful interactions between theory and data can be."*
- [Statistical mechanics for natural flocks of birds - modelling flock behaviour](http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/109/13/4786.full.pdf) From the article: *"Flocking is a typical example of emergent collective behavior, where interactions between individuals produce collective patterns on the large scale. Here we show how a quantitative microscopic theory for directional ordering in a flock can be derived directly from field data. We construct the minimally structured (maximum entropy) model consistent with experimental correlations in large flocks of starlings."*

### Digital Signal Processing - Audio, Visual, and Other

- [Audio-Visual Speech Separation - Separating Audio Tracks From Video](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/04/looking-to-listen-audio-visual-speech.html) *"People are remarkably good at focusing their attention on a particular person in a noisy environment, mentally “muting” all other voices and sounds. Known as the cocktail party effect, this capability comes natural to us humans. However, automatic speech separation — separating an audio signal into its individual speech sources — while a well-studied problem, remains a significant challenge for computers."* The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03619.pdf).

- [Digital Signal Processing](http://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm) To quote the author of the guide in the link above: *"Digital Signal Processing is one of the most powerful technologies that will shape science and engineering in the twenty-first century. Revolutionary changes have already been made in a broad range of fields: communications, medical imaging, radar & sonar, high fidelity music reproduction, and oil prospecting, to name just a few. Each of these areas has developed a deep DSP technology, with its own algorithms, mathematics, and specialized techniques."*

His graphics, like a steaming cup of coffee, look simple in hindsight, but were anything but in the early 1990s.... His work on fast fluid flow computation in particular introduced techniques that were a breakthrough in visual fluid simulation and has deeply influenced dozens of researchers over the past 20 years."*

Positive links represent friendship while negative links represent antagonism, and an important problem in the study of social networks is to understand the tension between these two forces.."*

[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) *"Youtube channel that puts out fantastic videos intended to develop mathematical intuition, and motivating the subject. It includes possibly the best introduction to the subject of Linear Algebra I've ever come across. His calculus series is pretty great too. You should watch these in conjunction with the above resources."*

Misc Advice:
*Math is not a spectator sport. Your brain learns by doing and practicing, not watching and reading. That means you need to do exercises. If you don't reinforce the lectures with problems you solve yourself, the knowledge will slip away over time. By the time you come back to it a month later, you'll have forgotten it all.*
