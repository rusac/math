### Usefulness of mathematics

- [Digital Signal Processing](http://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm)

To quote the author of the guide in the link above: *"Digital Signal Processing is one of the most powerful technologies that will shape science and engineering in the twenty-first century. Revolutionary changes have already been made in a broad range of fields: communications, medical imaging, radar & sonar, high fidelity music reproduction, and oil prospecting, to name just a few. Each of these areas has developed a deep DSP technology, with its own algorithms, mathematics, and specialized techniques."*
