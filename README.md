### Astronomy

- [The Cosmic Distance Ladder - History of Measuring Distances to Heavenly Bodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ne0GArfeMs&t=5m57s)

Terence Tao discusses how we have determined the distance to the moon, sun, planets, and so on, describing the mathematics and technology at each 'rung' of the ladder.

### Complex Numbers

- [Quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion)

Quaternions are used for 'calculations involving three-dimensional rotations', such as in aeronautics and robotics. 

### Digital Signal Processing

- [Digital Signal Processing](http://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm)

To quote the author of the guide in the link above: *"Digital Signal Processing is one of the most powerful technologies that will shape science and engineering in the twenty-first century. Revolutionary changes have already been made in a broad range of fields: communications, medical imaging, radar & sonar, high fidelity music reproduction, and oil prospecting, to name just a few. Each of these areas has developed a deep DSP technology, with its own algorithms, mathematics, and specialized techniques."*
